# Fraktal
I wanted to draw som fractals so i did. Now i want to turn it up a notch.
So the green Line in Vase, N=5.pdf is Fraktal N = 0. I thought that in antic egypt, they 
might have drawn vases like that, so called it a vase. Pot might would have been better.
Anyways. The structure is simple: 

If you draw the fractal by hand, you would draw the vase (pot) and then in the next step
just replace the straigt line by a vase (pot). Then you would get Vase,N=1.pdf. And then you
do the whole process again to get to N=2.

I drew N = 0 by hand and then the algorithm takes over. 
The algorithm does nothing other then looking weither the original straight 
lines of N-1 is vertical horizontal and wether it goes from left to right. 
One can do that simply by taking the differences of the endpoints of the line. 
Accordingly it draws the same vase (pot) instead of the straight line.
